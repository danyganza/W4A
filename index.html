                        The ability of a cow or heifer to successfully mate, conceive, give birth, and raise a healthy
                        calf
                        each year is essential for profitable and sustainable beef production. A good understanding of
                        anatomy and physiology of both the male and female is helpful in successfully managing
                        reproduction.

                    Cows are known as domestic animals. They are raised like cattle for meat, milk, and hides to make
                    leather. Cows are also serving as pets. Cows love to be social as humans they always stay in groups,
                    for developing bonds.
